# TechDegree Project 1
 My first TechDegree project.

In this project I've built a console game that has exercised the skills and concepts you have learned in Unit 1 of Treehouse's Python Techdegree program.. This game is  called 'the Number Guessing Game' or 'the Pick A Number game'.

Description:
Have you ever played a game with your friends where you ask them to pick a number between some range of numbers like: "Pick a number between 1 and 10". Their job is to make a guess, and you tell them whether their guess is too high or too low. Their next guess is based on what you've told them. If they guess the right answer the game is done. Normally you try to do this in the lowest number of tries possible. Often it is used to compete with friends to see who can get the answer in the lowest number of guesses.

Program has the following criteria:
1. Display an intro/welcome message to the player.
2. Store a random number as the answer/solution.
3. Continuously prompt the player for a guess.
  a. If the guess greater than the solution, display to the player "It's lower".
  b. If the guess is less than the solution, display to the player "It's higher".
4. Once the guess is correct, stop looping, inform the user they "Got it",  and show how many attempts it took them to get the correct number.
5. Let the player know the game is ending, or something that indicates the game is over.
